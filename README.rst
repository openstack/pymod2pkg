pymod2pkg
=========

`pymod2pkg` is a simple python module for translating python module names to
corresponding package names which is a common problem in the packaging world.
It is used for the OpenStack rpm packaging initiative.
For more information about the OpenStack rpm packaging initiative, please
follow the link to the wiki page:

   https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rpm-packaging

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/pymod2pkg

Developers wishing to work on pymod2pkg should always base
their work on the latest code, available from the master GIT
repository at:

   https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/pymod2pkg
