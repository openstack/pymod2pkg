pymod2pkg
=========

`pymod2pkg` is a simple python module for translating python module names to
corresponding package names which is a common problem in the packaging world.

.. note:: Note that rdopkg_ uses this module to check whether packages
          corresponding to `requirements.txt` are available across distros
          and more.

.. _rdopkg: https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdopkg

Installation
============

From source
***********

If you want to hack `pymod2pkg` or just have the latest version without
waiting for next release, I suggest using the git repo directly a la

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/pymod2pkg.git
   cd pymod2pkg
   python setup.py develop --user


From PyPI
*********

For your convenience, `pymod2pkg` is also available from the Cheese
Shop:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pymod2pkg

Usage
=====

`module2package` is probably all you need, it accepts a module name to convert
and a linux distribution name as returned by `platform.linux_distribution()[0]`:

.. code-block:: python

   import pymod2pkg
   pkg = pymod2pkg.module2package('six', 'Fedora')

An `upstream` map is also provided, to translate python module names to
OpenStack project names.

There's not much more, really, so RTFS.

Fixing/extending the map
========================

Currently, only package maps for RPM-based systems and upstream OpenStack are
provided, but it'd be nice to have all the distros covered and it's really
easy to do.

See `*_PKG_MAP` and `get_pkg_map`, hack it to your liking and submit review by

.. code-block:: shell

   git review


Running the testsuite
=====================

Run tests by:

.. code-block:: shell

   python tests.py
